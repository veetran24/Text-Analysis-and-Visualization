The bar chart visualization aims to clearly present the frequency of appearance of 11 major Harry Potter characters across the book series. The figure size of (10, 6) provides ample space for legible labels while maintaining a compact plot. Blue colored bars offer visual appeal without distraction. The x and y axis labels use 14 point bold font for emphasis and prominence. I did rotating x-axis labels by 45 degrees prevents overlap, and setting the font size to 12 ensures readability. Also,data labels directly on the bars enhance interpretability as does the 12 point font size which be placed slightly above the bars to show the frequency value of each character names mentioned in the books. The 18 point bold title concisely conveys the plot's purpose. A more descriptive title like "Frequency of Major Character Appearances across Harry Potter Book Series" could provide additional context, but may be too lengthy. The 10 point caption adds useful information on the data source for the plot. Overall, design choices regarding color, font sizes, label rotation, and data labeling aim to balance visual appeal with interpretability. Decisions around font size in particular focus on drawing attention to the most important elements like axes labels, while preserving readability. The result is a clean, easy to understand visualization supporting comprehension of character frequencies.
